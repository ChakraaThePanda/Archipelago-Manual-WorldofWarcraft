So, I was trying to find a WoW Randomizer that could be accessible to everyone who would like to go at it, without buying the game or paying the sub.

Couldn't find one, so I made one!

## Goal
* Find the 20 Gold Coins (out of 30)
## How to play
* You can only play the Specializations and Dungeons you have unlocked
* You will be given 1 Starting Specialization and 3 Random Dungeons from all the available dungeons at level 10-20
* Clearing a dungeon you have unlocked gives you 2 items
